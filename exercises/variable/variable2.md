In JavaScript, when you declare a variable with `const`, you must initialize it with a value at the time of declaration. This is because `const` is used for constants which cannot be reassigned after their initial assignment. If you declare a `const` without an initial value, JavaScript will throw a syntax error.

Hint:
- Review the variable declaration and initialization rules for `const`. Remember that constants not only need to be declared but also assigned an initial value in the same statement. Since the code expects `x` to be a number, consider what value you can assign to `x` when you declare it to satisfy the type check and the subsequent conditions.

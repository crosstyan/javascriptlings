Hint:

- In strict mode, all variables must be declared before they are used. This means you need to explicitly declare your variables using `let`, or `const`. If you try to assign a value to an undeclared variable, JavaScript will throw a reference error. Check your code to ensure that every variable is declared properly. Reflect on the scope and lifetime requirements of your variable to decide whether `let`, `const` is the most appropriate keyword for its declaration.

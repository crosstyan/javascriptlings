In JavaScript, when you declare a variable with `const`, it means that the variable's value is constant and cannot be reassigned after its initial assignment. Attempting to reassign a `const` variable will result in a TypeError because `const` enforces immutability of the variable's value (at least at the level of primitive values).

Hint:
- Consider the rules around variable mutability and the keywords used to declare variables in JavaScript. Since the line that attempts to reassign `x` cannot be changed, think about how the initial declaration of `x` could be modified to comply with the requirement for `x` to have a different value later in the code. Reflect on the difference between `const`, `let`, especially in terms of their ability to allow reassignment.

Hint:

1. Run the code and observe the error message.
   - The error message will indicate that the `call_me` function expects an argument, but it is called without any arguments in the `main` function.

2. To fix the error, you need to pass an argument to the `call_me` function when calling it in the `main` function.
   - Determine the appropriate argument to pass based on the implementation of the `call_me` function.
   - The `call_me` function expects a number (`num`) as an argument, which determines the number of times the loop will run.

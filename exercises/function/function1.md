To resolve the error in the given code, you need to define the `call_me` function before it is called. The hints provided suggest four different ways to define a function in JavaScript. Each method has its own use case and scope behavior, but all can be used to define a function that can be called within `main`. Here's an expanded hint that includes explanations for each method:

1. **Function Declaration:**
   - `function call_me() { console.log("Called!"); }`
   - This is the most straightforward way to define a function. Function declarations are hoisted, meaning they are raised to the top of their scope before code execution. This allows them to be called before they are defined in the code.

2. **Function Expression with `const`:**
   - `const call_me = function() { console.log("Called!"); };`
   - Here, a function is defined and assigned to a constant variable. This method is not hoisted, so the function must be defined before it is called. Using `const` ensures that the variable cannot be reassigned.

3. **Function Expression with `var`:**
   - `var call_me = function() { console.log("Called!"); };`
   - Similar to the previous method, but the function is assigned to a variable declared with `var`. Variables declared with `var` are hoisted, but the assignment of the function to the variable is not. This means the variable exists from the start of the scope, but it will be `undefined` until the function is assigned to it.

4. **Arrow Function with `const`:**
   - `const call_me = () => { console.log("Called!"); };`
   - An arrow function is a concise way to write function expressions. It is syntactically shorter and does not have its own `this`, `arguments`, `super`, or `new.target`. Like function expressions, arrow functions are not hoisted, so they must be defined before they are used.

Remember, regardless of the method you choose, the function must be defined in a scope accessible to where it is called. In this case, since `call_me` is called inside the `main` function, `call_me` must be defined either in the same scope as `main` or in a higher (global) scope.

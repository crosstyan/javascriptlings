To resolve the error in the given code, you need to define the `call_me` function before it is called. The hints provided suggest four different ways to define a function in JavaScript. Each method has its own use case and scope behavior, but all can be used to define a function that can be called within `main`. Here's an expanded hint that includes explanations for each method:

- **Function Declaration:**
   - `function call_me() { console.log("Called!"); }`
   - This is the most straightforward way to define a function. Function
   declarations are hoisted, meaning they are raised to the top of their scope
   before code execution. This allows them to be called before they are defined
   in the code.

- **Arrow Function with `const`:**
   - `const call_me = () => { console.log("Called!"); };`
   - An arrow function is a concise way to write *function expressions*. It is
   syntactically shorter and does not have its own `this`, `arguments`, `super`,
   or `new.target`. Like function expressions, arrow functions are not hoisted,
   so they must be defined before they are used.

Two methods above cover the most common ways to define functions in JavaScript
(I prefer the arrow function by the way, since the alignment to the semantic of
function as value, which is common in functional programming). Here are more
methods that are less common but still valid:

- **Function Expression with `var`:**
   - `var call_me = function() { console.log("Called!"); };`
   - Similar to the previous method, but the function is assigned to a variable
   declared with `var`. Variables declared with `var` are hoisted, but the
   assignment of the function to the variable is not. This means the variable
   exists from the start of the scope, but it will be `undefined` until the
   function is assigned to it.
   - Note: Using `var` is generally **discouraged** in modern JavaScript due to its
   scoping behavior.  It's mentioned here since it's a popular way to define
   functions in pre-ES6 JavaScript, which you will see in older codebases.

- **Function Expression with `const`:**
   - `const call_me = function() { console.log("Called!"); };`
   - Here, a function is defined and assigned to a constant variable. This
   method is not hoisted, so the function must be defined before it is called.
   Using `const` ensures that the variable cannot be reassigned.
   - Note: I don't see this method used as often as the others, but it's a valid.

- **Function Expression with `let`:**
   - `let call_me = function() { console.log("Called!"); };`
   - Why would you use `let` to define a function? Do you really want to
   reassign the function to another value? 

- **Arrow Function with `let`:**
   - `let call_me = () => { console.log("Called!"); };`
   - Nothing different from the arrow function with `const`, but you can
   reassign, which you shouldn't.

Remember, regardless of the method you choose, the function must be defined in a scope accessible to where it is called. In this case, since `call_me` is called inside the `main` function, `call_me` must be defined either in the same scope as `main` or in a higher (global) scope.
